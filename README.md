The standard 256 colour scheme ported to `guifg` and `guibg`, with some minor
legibility enhancements.

This is useful if you want gVim to look the same as Vim from a terminal, or if
you enable `termguicolours` to tweak only one or two colours, without everything
looking different.

Usage:

	:set termguicolors
	:colorscheme default2
